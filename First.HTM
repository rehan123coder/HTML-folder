      <h2>fact about cats</h2>
      <P>Here’s a bigger fact: Cats have a special reflective layer behind their retinas called the **tapetum lucidum**, which enhances their night vision. This allows them to see in light levels six times lower than what humans need. It’s why their eyes seem to glow in the dark! Cats are also incredible jumpers and can leap up to six times their body length in a single bound.</P>
