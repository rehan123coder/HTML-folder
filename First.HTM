       <h1>HONEY BEES</h1>
       <p></p>
Honey bees play a crucial role in ecosystems worldwide. These small but mighty insects are responsible for pollinating about 75% of the worldâ€™s flowering plants, including many of the crops we rely on for food. Without honey bees, the production of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds would significantly decline, threatening global food security. In addition to their vital role in pollination, honey bees produce honey, beeswax, and other valuable byproducts. Despite their importance, honey bee populations are facing serious threats due to habitat loss, pesticides, and diseases. Protecting honey bees is essential for maintaining biodiversity and ensuring the sustainability of our food systems.
